# Bikesharing with Citi Bike

## Project Overview of the Citi Bike Analysis
#### The goal of this project was to determine the viability of a bikesharing startup in Des Moines, Iowa.
This analysis was done on all the bike trips taken in New York City during the month of August 2019.  By analyzing traffic patterns and distribution, investors can see the overall usage in a major metropolitan area. 

#### Resources
- Data: [link to data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and click on `Download Citi Bike trip history data` halfway down the page.
- Software:  Tableau Public
- Tableau Dashboard: [Citi Bike August 2019 Bike Trips](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sam.frost/viz/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis_16236416696240/NYCCitiBike)

## Results of the Analysis
When opening the Tableau Public Dashboard, the first visualization will be the interactive image below.  By hovering over the station the location, coordinates, and the number of trips to or from the location will be displayed.  By clicking on one of the station locations you will be taken to a Google street view of the location.

The final sheet in the story is an interactive map of all the Citi Bike stations.


## Summary
Because the New York City population is significantly greater than that of Des Moines, using New York City as a model for the viability of a comparable business may be inappropriate.  The 2019 population of Des Moines was just over 215,000 while the population of New York City was almost 8.5 million.  In addition to the large disparity in population, the number of visitors that New York City hosted for that year was 66.6 million.  In order to set reasonable expectations for investors, two additional visualizations that might be helpful for future analysis are the following:
1.  Scaling the total numbers from the New York Citi Bike data set to draw a closer parallel to Des Moines population and visitor numbers.
2.  A count of the number of bikes that are taken out of service because they have become damaged or are outside of their life-cycle.
